## Reason for creation:
My vacuum cleaner broke. I had bought it on AliExpress.

I contacted customer support, and they suggested I record a video so their engineers could diagnose the problem.

I recorded it using my mobile phone, but the file turned out to be huge.
I needed to compress it and convert it to the popular MP4 format.
